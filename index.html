	<p>Lion! Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Surround yourself with angels. I’m up to something. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.</p>

	<p>Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. How’s business? Boomin. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. Bless up. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. We the best. Special cloth alert. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed.</p>
